       "\"THERE are only 14 road bridges across the Thames in central London, and now one of them is shut. Indefinitely.The sludge green Hammersmith Bridge is apparently so weak that not even a mouse is allowed to cross it.8 Jeremy Clarkson is not impressed with the closure of Hammersmith Bridge Credit: Getty - ContributorAnd because it may collapse at any moment, not even a stickleback is allowed to swim underneath it.The effects of this are enormous. Kids are now being forced to do three-hour trips to get to a school which is only a few hundred yards from where they live.Old ladies are saying that it takes them half a day, on an endless series of buses, to get to the doctor’s.And the closure is making Britain look like a laughing stock.The New York Times ran a story last week saying that London’s bridges really are falling down.So you’d imagine that teams of engineers in sturdy shoes and hard hats are working round the clock to find a solution. Sadly not.8 A task force has been set up to study fixing the bridge Credit: Press AssociationHammersmith and Fulham council, which owns the bridge, says it can’t afford to do the necessary repairs.And Transport for London say it’s not their problem.They can’t even agree on how big the problem is.One report last week said that, before the closure, the bridge was carrying 16,000 people a day and 22,000 vehicles.Really? So some of these vehicles had no people in them?Now, if I were transport minister, I would call a meeting of all the people in charge and explain, while brandishing an extremely large machine gun, that if they couldn’t get the problem solved in six months, everyone involved would go to prison for the rest of their lives.8 Transport minister Grant Shapps has set up a government task force Credit: PA:Press AssociationBut I’m not the transport minister. Grant Shapps is.And what he’s done is set up a government task force.What good’s that, you imbecile? The Government can never do anything.It doesn’t order aprons when a pandemic is coming. It can’t understand that contractors take the p*** when supplying quotes.It supplies troops in a war zone with chef’s trousers, not guns.It buys aircraft carriers when it has no planes that can land on them.8 Why can't the Government do anything properly, asks Clarkson Credit: spegel.coIt lets the police stand around while people daub Churchill’s statue with slogans saying he was a racist.It thinks it has a Brexit deal when it doesn’t. It gives foreign aid to countries which are richer than we are.It has no control of our borders. It sells our gold when prices are rock bottom. It has no idea how many people live here.It starts wars when it has no idea how to finish them.And when it decided to throw us a New Year’s Eve party in December 1999, it put up a tent filled with faith zones and bugger all else.The Chinese government could cope. In fact it did. When a bridge in Beijing — which had about the same span as Hammersmith Bridge — developed a fault, they had a replacement up and running in 43 hours.Not months. Not weeks. Hours!!!And I’m sorry, but if we want that kind of drive and panache here, there’s only one solution. Hand the problem over to the private sector.Tell a construction company they can charge tolls if they can put up a new bridge quickly, and I guarantee they’d have the job done by Monday morning at about 10.30.Which means that on Monday afternoon they could start work on repairing Brighton West Pier, which burned down 17 years ago and is now just sitting there looking like a set of ruined, blackened teeth stumps in the mouth of a former supermodel who developed a fondness for crystal meth.There's no fun in fungiIF you go for a walk in the countryside at this time of year, you’ll find that many fields are carpeted with a thick layer of mushrooms.You can eat all of them. But some of them only once.8 Stay away from wild mushrooms, says Clarkson Credit: Getty Images - GettyAnd that’s the problem. Some mushrooms will kill you stone dead in about 20 seconds.Some will make you fall about laughing at stuff that isn’t funny, such as Keir Starmer’s hair, and some are absolutely delicious.But how do you tell which is which?Happily, a new app was launched this week which helps you do just that.But sadly, there are lots of apps which claim to do the same thing and many have been branded “misleading” by experts.And that’s like having “misleading” advice at a level crossing.Which is why I always get my mushrooms from the safest place of all: The supermarket.German Koch-up THE German army has just cut its ties with its home gunmaker, Heckler & Koch, saying that in future it will get its hardware from a company in the Middle East. But it’s not the end of the world as Heckler & Koch won a £65million order from the British Army last year. Mind you, if history repeats itself and we end up having another war with Germany there’s going to be the most awful kerfuffle about who uses which guns.What the Elle will they do8 Where will Elle Macpherson go on holiday this year? Credit: BackGridSO, a crashed oil tanker has ruined the beaches in Mauritius, Islamic militants have seized a cluster of idyllic islands off Mozambique and now comes news that Barbados is ditching the Queen as its head of state and becoming a republic.At this rate there’ll be nowhere for the world’s bikini enthusiasts, such as Elle Macpherson, to go on holiday when this Covid business eventually ends.No way Jose8 It's hard not to like Jose Mourinho when you watch All Or Nothing Credit: Rex FeaturesAMAZON’S All Or Nothing documentary, which follows Spurs over one tumultuous year, is a masterclass in programme making, and a fascinating insight into how a football club works behind the scenes.I have hated every minute of it. Because as a Chelsea fan, I don’t want to see Dele Alli being funny and Heung-Min Son being brilliant and Eric Dier talking about his vegetable garden.Nor do I want to see Jose Mourinho winning anything.I want to hate these people and it’s bloody hard to do that when you get to know them.Blimey, greens get itI NEVER thought I’d see the day, but this week Greenpeace made an announcement and I found myself nodding in agreement.They are saying that so-called “green” plug-in hybrids are nothing of the sort because while many only produce 44g of carbon dioxide for every kilometre in laboratory tests, that shoots up to 117g in the real world.8 Hybrid cars fail to deliver on their promises, say Greenpeace Credit: Getty Images - GettyIt means that many produce nearly as much greenhouse gas as a standard petrol car. I’ve been saying that for years.And actually the problem is even worse, because a hybrid has two engines, which have to be manufactured in massive factories.Most read in News LOCKED UP AGAIN New lockdown rules explained: Everything you can and can’t do now CLUB FURY Footballer who beat girlfriend & forced her to eat paint signs to new club WINTER COMING England may have to ban home visits too as SAGE adviser warns lockdown coming SKIN DEEP Skin rash IS Covid symptom, experts warn - the 8 different types revealed MASS EVACUATION Thousands forced to leave mega caravan park as Covid lockdown rules kick in RALLYING CRY PM says 'pull together' and warns 'your cough could be someone's death knell'And a heavy bank of batteries which have to be made using stuff dug out of mines in Africa, by children.If you really want to be as green as can be, you need a pure electric car.

      "Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance says measures must be taken to stop the spread of Covid-19The UK could see 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action, the government's chief scientific adviser has warned.Sir Patrick Vallance said that would be expected to lead to about \"200-plus deaths per day\" a month after that.It comes as the PM prepares to chair a Cobra emergency committee meeting on Tuesday morning, then make a statement in the House of Commons.On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases were reported in the UK, up from 3,899.A further 11 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test, although these figures tend to be lower over the weekend and on Mondays due to reporting delays.Speaking at Downing Street alongside chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick stressed the figures given were not a prediction, but added: \"At the moment we think the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days.\n",
      "Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.05)\n",
      "\"If, and that's quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day.\n",

      "\"So we have, in a bad sense, literally turned a corner, although only relatively recently,\" he said.Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick also said:The rising case numbers can not be blamed on an increase in testing as there is also an \"increase in positivity of the tests done\"Around 70,000 people in the UK are estimated to currently have the disease - and about 6,000 per day are catching it (based on an ONS study)Less than 8% of the population has been infected, although the figure could be as high as 17% in LondonThe rising transmission is a serious \"six-month problem that we have to deal with collectively\" - but science will eventually \"ride to our rescue\"The virus is not milder now than in April, despite claims to the contraryIt is possible \"that some vaccine could be available before the end of the year in small amounts for certain groups\" but \"the first half of next year\" is much more likelyThe government's most senior science and medical advisers are clearly concerned about the rise in cases that have been seen in recent weeks.The warning about 50,000 cases a day by mid-October is stark.\n",

      "We don't know for sure how many cases there were at the peak in spring (as there was very limited testing in place) although some estimates put it at 100,000.However, they were also at pains to point out it was not a prediction - for one thing the 'rule of six' which came in just a week ago has not had time to have an impact.Even among the government's own advisers there is disagreement over whether what we are seeing is the start of an exponential rise or just a gradual increase in cases, which is what you would expect at this time of year as respiratory viruses tend to circulate more with the reopening of society.Spain and France, which both started seeing rises earlier than the UK, have not seen the sort of rapid trajectory that was presented by the advisers.Instead, what was quite telling was the clear social messaging.\n",

      "Or should they crack down early, knowing that will have a negative impact in other ways?Prof Whitty also said that even though different parts of the UK were seeing cases rising at different rates, and even though some age groups were affected more than others, the evolving situation was \"all of our problem\".He added that evidence from other countries showed infections were \"not staying just in the younger age groups\" but were \"moving up the age bands\".He said mortality rates from Covid-19 were \"significantly greater\" than seasonal flu, which killed around 7,000 annually or 20,000 in a bad year.Meanwhile, restrictions on households mixing indoors will be extended to all of Northern Ireland from 18:00 BST on Tuesday.Areas in north-west England, West Yorkshire, the Midlands and four more counties in south Wales will also face further local restrictions from Tuesday.And additional lockdown restrictions will \"almost certainly\" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.\n",

       "'First it was the scientists, now it’s the turn of ministers.\\n\\nOn Monday the government\\'s two most senior coronavirus advisers - Prof Chris Witty and Sir Patrick Vallance - set out the scale of the problem. Today ministers are coming forward with the solution.\\n\\nThe scientists\\' warning was dire – the UK could see 50,000 cases by mid October – up from under 4,000 a day on average currently.\\n\\nThe government\\'s response? So far what we’ve heard on government policy for England is that pubs will have to close early and that you should work from home if you can (although more restrictions may be announced later).\\n\\nThere seems to be a disconnect between the two. Why?\\n\\nSome experts have described the 50,000 figures as implausible. France and Spain – who are a few weeks ahead of us – are nowhere near that trajectory. What is more, the \"rule of six\" brought in last week has not had a chance to have an impact.\\n\\nMany believe what we are seeing now is a natural drift upwards – society has reopened and it is the time of year when respiratory viruses circulate more.\\n\\nSo why all the doom and gloom? There are three ways of looking at it. Firstly, that we are truly on the brink of an explosion in cases (they after all are the experts and have access to all the data).\\n\\nSecondly, that they are panicking and have turned to scaremongering to soften the public up for more restrictions. The other is that they are trying to influence behaviour so more Draconian restrictions are not needed.\\n\\nJust how far the prime minister goes this afternoon will be telling.'"

       "'Image copyright Getty Images\\n\\nAnyone renewing their home or motor insurance should pay no more than they would as a new customer, under a proposed shake-up of the sector.\\n\\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the \"radical\" reforms would save consumers £3.7bn over 10 years.\\n\\nIf adopted, the plans would see customers, old and new, buying on the same channel getting the same price.\\n\\nSo those buying, for example, online would get the equivalent deal, whether renewing or a new customer.\\n\\nChristopher Woolard, interim chief executive of the FCA, said: \\'We are consulting on a radical package that would ensure firms cannot charge renewing customers more than new customers in future, and put an end to the very high prices paid by some long-standing customers.\"\\n\\nThe FCA has been studying ways to prevent six million people paying on average £200 too much on premiums.\\n\\nOverall, the FCA had suggested consumers were overpaying by £1.2bn a year.\\n\\nHow price rises affect you\\n\\nSo-called price walking is when a customer is charged more, year after year, by staying with the same insurance company - even though their risk is no greater.\\n\\nThe FCA points to an example in which a new customer for home insurance typically pays £130 for a year\\'s cover.\\n\\nBut for the same policy, having stayed with the same insurer for five years, that annual premium rises to £238.\\n\\nFor motor insurance, new customers pay £285 while customers who have been with their provider for more than five years pay £370, according to the FCA\\'s example.\\n\\n\\'Loyalty penalty\\'\\n\\nThe FCA has been looking to tackle the loyalty penalty - a result in the growth, and encouragement, of shopping around for insurance, overdrafts and utilities.\\n\\nThose who switch get the best deals as new customers. Those who stay loyal get charged more.\\n\\nTen million policies across home and motor insurance are held by people who have been with their provider for five years or more.\\n\\nThis is accentuated by the poverty premium - you get a worse deal if your finances are less \"resilient\", you struggle with handling money, or do not have internet access to find the cheapest deals.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Motor cover is one of the area\\'s investigated by the FCA\\n\\nThe regulator\\'s research into household and motor insurance had already found that more than one in 10 people were paying very high prices for their cover. One in three of them were vulnerable in some way, perhaps elderly or lower paid.\\n\\nIt said that some insurers targeted price increases at those less likely to switch. Insurers also made it difficult for some customers to stop automatic renewals at higher prices, such as leaving them waiting a long time on the phone to cancel.\\n\\nHowever, the FCA also found that those switching very regularly are likely to be flagged by insurers, and possibly blocked from the best deals.\\n\\nSo, somebody considered to be a savvy shopper by looking around would also be penalised.\\n\\nUnder these proposals, some of the cheapest deals could disappear from the market anyway as insurers protect their income.\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\nUnder the proposals, firms would be free to set prices for new customers, but they would be prevented from gradually increasing the renewal price to consumers over time, other than in line with changes in a customer\\'s risk.\\n\\nFirms would also need to consider how they offered fair value to all customers over the longer term and were being told to report certain data to the FCA, so that it could check the rules are being followed.\\n\\nThe proposals will now go to consultation until late January, and could come into force during next year.\\n\\nDame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, called for swift implementation of the plan.\\n\\n\"It is nearly two years since we submitted a super-complaint on the loyalty penalty and we\\'re pleased to see the FCA is proposing strong action to crack down on this systematic scam,\" she said.\\n\\nThe Association of British Insurers (ABI), which represents the sector, said there were winners and losers under the current system.\\n\\n\"Insurers and brokers have already begun to tackle the issue of excessive price differences between new and existing customers through an industry initiative that has seen over 8.5 million pricing interventions across home and motor insurance worth £641m,\" said ABI director general Huw Evans.\\n\\n\"It is vital that price comparison websites and insurance brokers are subject to the same level of supervision and monitoring by the FCA to ensure a balanced approach.\"'"
